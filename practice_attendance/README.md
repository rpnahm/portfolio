# Practice Attendance Project
A selection of python scripts designed to modify google sheets to keep track of the Climbing Club practice attendance and dues. Sure this could've been done entirely in a spreadsheet, but that's not ad fun. 

## Technologies used:
- Python Scripts
- Pandas Dataframes
- Google REST API
- Pygsheets
